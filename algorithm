Temperature

Vibration

Runtime hours

Maintenance patterns

For each machine, AI calculates:

Servicing probability (0–100%)

Risk level (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

Key indicators

Recommended action

Priority score (1–10)

AI also generates:

Total machines

Number of critical machines

Average risk

Overall recommendations

Backend sends results back to frontend.

Step 5: Display Results

Stop loading.

Show summary:

Total machines

Critical machines

Average risk

Recommendations

For each machine:

Convert results into CSV format.

Download file.

If user clicks Download PDF:

Create PDF report.

Add summary.

Add machine table.

Download file.

Step 7: End

User can upload another file or logout.

System ends.
